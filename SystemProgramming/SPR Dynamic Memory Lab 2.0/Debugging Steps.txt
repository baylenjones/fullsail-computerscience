Write your debugging steps and thought process here (This is part of your grade)
1. run Debug and identify the number of memory leaks (30+).
2. read through code, identify New keyword for memory allocation. Match up delete calls. if no delete call, insert a delete[] call where appropriate
	as not to break the program or change its intended design.
3. items fixed:
	store s
	helperItem
	m_Inventories
	m_Value
	nSize
4. review classes and functions to make sure all are being properly deallocated in destructors.
5. rerun debug to identify memory leaks (0 left);
